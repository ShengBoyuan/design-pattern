# design-pattern
Study notes for design pattern, mainly from 'dive into design pattern'. I'll implement these patterns with Go.

The Factory Pattern is harder than I though, it took me about 2 hours to read this part 
and implement with Go, let alone the extensions such as Pros & Cons, Relation with other Patterns, Application details, etc. But it's quite interesting while using Go to implement my own design. In a way, design patterns is a little bit abstract, it takes a really long period and much development experience to fully understand and use them. Hope I can enjoy the process ~
