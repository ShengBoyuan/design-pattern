The Factory Pattern is harder than I though, it took me about 2 hours to read this part and implement with Go, let alone the extensions such as Pros & Cons, Relation with other Patterns, Application details, etc. But it's quite interesting while using Go to implement my own design. In a way, design patterns is a little bit abstract, it takes a really long period and much development experience to fully understand and use them. Hope I can enjoy the process ~

Difficult the first time, easy the second. Abstract Factory cost me about one hour and a half. I'm a little confused by the difference between Factory Method and Abstract Factory. It seems Abstract Factory is superset of Factory Method, it's a deeper abstraction of Factory & Products, which suits for more complicated business scenarios. The matrix of concrete products impressed me a lot, I wonder if Abstract Factory still works when the matrix includes several blank parts.

My team leader is on leave tody, so I get a lot of time for reading and learning. Builder Pattern is really complex, both understanding and implementing. I think I'm getting fascinated by these fantastic methodology. The process of implementing them on my own is of great fun, hope every developer can feel this fun.
